A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/jonhuther/pen/voAtJ.

 You are required to write code in the language of your choice implementing certain algorithms that
analyze rectangles and features that exist among rectangles. Your implementation is required to cover
the following:

1. Intersection: You must be able to determine whether two rectangles have one or more
intersecting lines and produce a result identifying the points of intersection. For your
convenience, the scenario is diagrammed in Appendix 1.

2. Containment: You must be able to determine whether a rectangle is wholly contained within
another rectangle. For your convenience, the scenario is diagrammed in Appendix 2.

3. Adjacency: Implement the ability to detect whether two rectangles are adjacent. Adjacency is
defined as the sharing of a side. Side sharing may be proper or sub-line, where a sub-line share
is one where one side of rectangle A is a line that exists as a set of points wholly contained on
some other side of rectangle B. For your convenience, the scenario is diagrammed in Appendix
3.

Your implementation should capture the rectangle entity as well as the operations listed above. Feel
free to expand on this problem as you wish. Document any expansion and provide it as part of your
submission.
